#FT Printf
`ft_printf` is a small replica of `printf` function in c. This is a proyect created for an assigment in 42 Barcelona school.

# How to use it
`ft_printf` is dependent of `libft` library. So you need to add in `libs/` folder the this library.

This could be a basic structure for you project:

```
\my-proyect
	|_ srcs/
	|_ includes/
	|_ libs/
		|_libft
			|_ Makefile
			|_ libft.h
			|- ...
		|_ ft_printf
			|_ Makefile
			|_ ft_printf.h
			|_ ...

```
